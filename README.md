## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a recent Computer Science graduate (GPA 8.85/10) with a strong passion for Big Data Engineering.

Although I am just starting my professional career, I have dedicated my academic journey to mastering complex data systems. My focus lies in Apache Spark, Data Modeling, and Cloud Architectures. I strive to bridge the gap between academic theory and production-grade engineering by building systems that are not just functional, but scalable and reliable.

- 🔭 Focus: Building end-to-end Data Lakehouses using the Medallion Architecture.
- 🌱 Learning: Deepening knowledge in Distributed Systems and Data Governance.
- ⚡ Motto: "Turning raw data into structured insights."
